Here, you find the explanation of all codes:

___________________________________________
averages_plot_2x.py / averages_plot_1pct.py

Make plots showing the mean temperature increase and the temperature increase based on a chosen number of ensemble members.

____________
conv_1pct.py

Calculates the convolution for the 20 runs of the 2x CO2 experiment

_____________________________________
convolution_em_predic_multiple_2x.py

Makes projections for a chosen number of ensemble members.

________________________
ensemblemembers_error.py

Calculates the error (over time and maximum) for a chosen number of ensemble members for both experiment. Can be adjusted to fit the other experiment. 

_____________________________________
error_tempchanges_projections_1pct.py

Calculates new projections for a chosen number of ensemble members
Then, compares it to a chosen baseline measurement (e.g., the 20-projection or the average of the 20 runs from the experiment).
It also calculates the maximum error that occurs for that number of em.

___________________________________
mean_temp_2x.py / mean_temp_1pct.py

Calculate the annual global mean temperature for the experiments.
